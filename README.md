# SafeBot

At Spectra Hackathon, SafeBot was created.

SafeBot is a user-driven web app that provides the ability for users to alert their friends when they feel unsafe by sending them a sms with their current location using Google Maps' API.
 
The User simply pushes a button and Safebot will send out sms to his/her friends using Twillio's API.
